# BookLogger

Hi, Loukik here! You may know of me from my previous project - I came up with "BookKeeperPY" which reads through a directory and generates a CSV of your book catalog.

A couple of years ago, I had the idea of catalogging my TBR (To Be Read) with a digital record. I started off with MS Excel, got bored of the interface and tried a handful of apps - Trello, Notion, Google Keep, OneNote, Google Sheets. But each of them came with their own nitpicks and I never could last more than a year on each platform.

In this time period, I also evolved as a developer & got exposed to new technologies. As a result, I've built "BookLogger". This is a Python/PyQT based application, which shows a form-like UI. It connects to an SQLite database & will store the details of your TBR & existing books. This is how the UI will look when inserting data:

This project is a _little_ more complex than BookKeeper, so it will require more things:
1) Python 3.x
2) PyQt 5 - Can be bundled with Python in an Anaconda environment
3) An SQLite 3 Database

I'm still building major functionalities of the app, so this repository will be a WIP for a while! :)

Until then, happy reading!!
